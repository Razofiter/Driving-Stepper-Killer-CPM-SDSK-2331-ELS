# Driving-Stepper-Killer-CPM-SDSK-2331S-ELS
This project is intended to drive the servomotor CPM-SDSK-2331-ELS using a prototyped board, based on the microcontroller stm32f103C8T.
The code was tested on stm32f103C8T. The following should be highlighted:
- HARDWARE: prototype board that acts as driver for the servomotor(picture will be added soon...)
            12 V, 1A power supply for the prototyped board that is accting as driver for the servomotor
            servomotor CPM-SDSK-2331S-ELS (see: https://www.teknic.com/model-info/CPM-SDSK-2331S-ELS/)
            recommended power supply for the servomotor - IPC-5 (see: https://www.teknic.com/IPC-5/)
